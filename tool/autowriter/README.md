there are two firmwares:

1 UVC: plugin USB line , connect to your computer , you will see video on your computer , it's just as usb camera.

2 Normal: "conprog.gz" is kernel  and "app_fs_jffs2.img" is jffs file system.

3 if burn firmware fail, maybe incompatible ,so please change "FA93_musb-o.bin" to "FA93_musb.bin" and retry.
