## Wiscam
RAK WisCam is ultra-low-cost Modular Based Evaluation Kit to help the developer to design Wi-Fi video product with Linux OS and work with Arduino NUO board. WisCam can transmit video through Wi-Fi to APPs and all the source codes are available on the Github. WisCam also integrate Nabto P2P cloud to create the video connection anywhere with Internet .
WisCam supports YUV RAW data so developers can make video scaling (up to x1~x8 scaling), video cropping , video overlapping etc. or change CMOS image sensor.
